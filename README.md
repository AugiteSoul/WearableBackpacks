# Wearable Backpacks

.. is a Minecraft mod which adds **backpacks**. But wait! It's not like anything you've
seen before. **Wearable Backpacks** continues the legacy of [BetterStorage][0]'s
backpacks, and brings with it a beautifully designed and balanced alternative backpack
option unlike any other!

*"Backpacks are love. Backpacks are life."* -asiekierka

## What's so great?

- **There can be only one!**  
  Where other mods store the contents of a backpack on the item itself, **WB** doesn't.
  When a backpack is equipped, its contents are actually kept with the player itself.
  This also means it's impossible to carry around multiple backpacks that contain items.

- **Armor up, or storage up?**  
  With the default settings, backpacks will function as armor, taking up the chest armor
  equipment slot, protecting from as well as taking damage just like leather armor. This
  way, you have to *choose* between more protection or more storage. This is fully
  configurable, though, in case you don't like it.

- **Play with friends, share backpacks!**  
  Having a backpack on your back looks cool and all, but if only you could do something
  with that beauty. Well, lucky you! Other players (hopefully, without ill intentions)
  can open your backpack and borrow a pick and some torches on a mining trip. This only
  works as long as your back is facing towards them, though.

- **Dying is [FUN][1]!**  
  Sick of losing all your valuables when you make a small little misstep into the nearest
  pool of lava? Don't worry, the items inside your backpack will be... mostly safe. While
  the backpack itself is not immune to explosions or being broken by other players, after
  death it will gently place itself down near your point of failure, ready to be
  retrieved.

- **Dyeing is fun~!**  
  Backpacks can be colored using Minecraft's *fantastic* dyeing system. Unlike some silly
  mods that only allow the 16 base colors, with our pretties you can mix and match your
  dyes to customize them in any way you like!

- **Configuration Nation**  
  One aim of **WB** is to be incredibly configurable, allowing backpacks to be balanced,
  whether they're used in a personal hand-picked pack, a huge kitchen sink modpack or a
  deadly hardcore-massacre-of-doom experience with sprinkles on top.

## Usage

Think of **Wearable Backpacks** backpacks as portable, wearable chests. After you've
crafted one, simply place it on the ground and fill it with whatever you'd like to take
with you. Next, **sneak** and **break** the backpack to **equip** it. You'll notice that
equipping is faster than breaking.

Now that the backpack is where it belongs (your back), you can **unequip** it again by
**sneaking** and **right-clicking** the ground with an **empty hand** (specifically, the
top of a solid block).
